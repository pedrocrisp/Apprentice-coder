# git stuff...

##git workflow:

    git status
    git add <file, or .>
    git diff --staged
    git commit -m "<notes>"
    git push

## Branches
To see all the branches (*denotes current branch)

    git branch

To change branches

    git checkout <branch>

To pull from Kevin's remote to my repo, RNAseqPipeline is set up as the default remote is origin

    git pull <remote> <branch>
    git pull kevin master

then to update my origin

    git push 

###create a new branch

    git checkout -b fixfeatureCounts master
Then on first push set the remote tracking at origin

    git push -u origin fixfeatureCounts

To add this branch on other machines/servers, pull and then checkout.  eg on server go to repository then:

    git pull
    git branch -r #see remote branches
    git checkout fixfeatureCounts

Once changes are finalised/tested switch back to master and merge

    git checkout master
    git merge fixfeatureCounts

Once changes are merged you can delete branch

    git branch -d fixfeatureCounts
If there are unmerged changes it will error, to force delete

    git branch -D fixfeatureCounts

## git ignore: 
go to top directory of repo and open or create .gitignore

    vim .gitignore

$ git add .gitignore
$ git status to check what is staged
$ git commit -m "initial commit for <new repo>" 
```
- go to github and make a new repo

```
    $ git pull origin master
    $ git push -u origin --all
```
